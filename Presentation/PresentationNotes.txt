        - hello
SLIDE 2
    - GAME OVERVIEW
        - Simple game where you control a turret to shoot little blobs with a laser
SLIDE 3
    - FEATURES
        - LASER
            - The turret fires a laser
            - it can produces fans of lasers if the laser is held and the player turns
            - it detects collisions with the borders and enemies
        - Explosions
            - When enemies die they trigger a particle effect I made with basic canvas shapes.
            - it's just a bunch of small circles, but they each have a lifetime and velocity so they animate themselves
        - MOUSE FOLLOW
            - turret chases after the mouse
            - the further away the mouse is the faster the turret moves
            - makes for more natural and more stratigic movement
        - MISC
            - The game has a lot of other features too
                - camerashake
                - waves of enemies
                - highscores
                - falloff damage for the Explosions
                - but I don't really have time to go through all of them
SLIDE 4
    - GREATEST TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
        - Laser had to collide with the enemy
        - both to cause damage and to know how long the laser had to be
        - infinite lines are super bad for performance
        - Spent about half a day working out the math for how circles and lines interact
        - in the end i found an equation for finding the number of intersections between a circle and a line
        - there was a more complicated equation for finding the exact point of contact, but I only needed to know if the laser hit or not
        - I'll spare you the math which involved subbing the line equation into the circle equation and doing a lot of algebra
        - but in the end I got some neat code that told me if the laser hit a circle/enemy.
SLIDE 5
    - BIGGEST MISTAKE
        - I actually managed to dodge a lot of big mistakes by spending an hour drawing out the program on paper and making sure it was properly organised.
        - One of the problems I did have though was when the player died I kept getting ghost players
            - randomly explode and fire lasers, usually at the player
        - This was because every enemy kept a reference to the player, so it could follow it
        - there was also a refence to the player in the list of enemies so I could loop through all of them to update positions more easily.
        - when the player died, it deleted itself from the list, but all the enemies kept their references
        - this created ghost players in the next game.
SLIDE 6
    - BIGGEST MISTAKE 2
        - I fixed it by only having one refence to the player, stored in window
        - the enemies all used the global variable to track the player instead of using a reference
        - when the player dies it destroys the one global reference so nothing else can access it.
        - It took a little while to weed out all of the scattered references, but this solved the problem completely.
