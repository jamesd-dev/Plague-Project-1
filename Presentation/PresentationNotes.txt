    - INTRO
        - hello
SLIDE 2
    - GAME OVERVIEW
        - Simple game where you control a turret to shoot little blobs with a laser
SLIDE 3
    - EXPLOSIONS
	- made with a lot of small objects
	- each with a velocity, acceleration, lifetime, size
	- each had some logic to animate it over time
	- lesson: interesting to see how big and dramatic results can be made by combining small simple independent things
	- Also amazing to see how much they added to the game. Simple to make, but there's a real child-like glee to be found in making little dots explode

    - COLLISIONS
        - Laser had to collide with the enemy
        - both to cause damage and to know how long the laser had to be
        - infinite lines are super bad for performance
        - Spent about half a day working out the math for how circles and lines interact
        - in the end i found an equation for finding the number of intersections between a circle and a line
        - there was a more complicated equation for finding the exact point of contact, but I only needed to know if the laser hit or not
        - I'll spare you the math which involved subbing the line equation into the circle equation and doing a lot of algebra
        - but in the end I got some neat code that told me if the laser hit a circle/enemy.
	- Lesson: you don't need to know everything.
	- you just need to be able to break something down into the right questions then go out and ask them
	- I don't know anything about circles and line, but I knew I had to get an equation concerning the two
	- and that was close enough to google.

    - DEMO
	- Efficiency
		- lots of enemies, particle effects, laser
		- lot of what I did was adding a cool new feature, then spending a day working out how to make it not kill my computer.
		- Explosions have a lot of objects, that all have to be updated.
			- make many, destroy faster. Flash bang effect
		- Enemies
			- small enemies are fast but big ones damage
			- player kills all the small enemies first
			- left with a load of slow big enemies to pick off.
			- played with adding huge numbers of small enemies
			- too many enemies killed the efficiency
			- solution was to occasionally make a big enemy break apart into a lot of little ones
			- population control
			- max 100
			- once the player killed a load the change to split went way up
			- meant I didn't have to include many enemies at the start
		- mouse control
			- faster further away
			- good for dodging
		- big explosion for player
		- waves
		- highscore
