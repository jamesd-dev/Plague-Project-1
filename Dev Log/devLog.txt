- Created the most basic framework for the project. Essentially getting the canvas to load
 and display the correct dimensions and installing a game loop.
- There were some problems, originally I had wanted a GameManager object to oversee the 
high-level game operations, but js wouldn't let the important built in functions like 
requestAnimationFrame to play nicely with a class. So that object is now spilled out all
 over a script. I'm hoping it won't get too messy as this project won't expand too much on
 that particular script.
- Finished the start screen. I ended up holding it in an object and creating a new instance everytime the state changes. It sounds complicated but I needed to do it to make sure everything was renewed
in a neat way.
- Also had problems witht he window click event. Every screen needs to se click but only one is ever active. So I included an event click function in each state to handle the logic and just got the window to run that function in the current gamestate object.
- Created the win and lose state by basically ripping off the start state and adding more text. It looks fine for the MVP even if it's all a bit generic.
- I also created the game state and included the basic (empty) functions it needs to operate as a state even if it has no parent.
- Pretty much just have to create the game now, and connect the logic that leads one screen to the next.
